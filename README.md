# LanJanitor
When you can't seem to keep your homelab servers up to date, let LanJanitor help!

## Overview
The idea for LanJanitor is to automate the boring job like installing updates...

We have enough of that at work already... Our homelab is supposed to be fun!
## The tech
The pieces that make LanJanitor work are:
* **Docker** - Because why not run it in a container
* **Bootstrap 5** - for page layout
* **AngularJS** - to make api calls and display info
* **Flask 2.x.x** - the brains of the operation
* **Sqlite DB** - the memory for the brain of the operation
* **Ansible** - the mop and bucket
